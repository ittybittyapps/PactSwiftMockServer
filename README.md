# PactSwiftMockServer

A wrapper around [`libpact_ffi.a`](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/tree/master/rust/pact_ffi) binary and exposed as XCFramework to be primarily used by [`PactSwift`](https://github.com/surpher/PactSwift).

But nothing is stopping you from creating your own interface using this package.
